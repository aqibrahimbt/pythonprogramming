 ### ( Dictionary) Task 1: Goal is to convert this to a dictionary:  
 #keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty'] 
 #values = [10, 20, 30]


### (Dictionary) Task 2: Merge the following two python dictionaries into one 
#dict1 = {'Ten':10, 'Twenty':20, 'Thirty':30}
#dict2 = {'Thirty':30, 'Fourty':40, 'Fifty':50}


### Task 3 - Given a two list. Create a third list by picking an odd-index element from the first list and even index elements from second.
#listOne = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21]
#listTwo = [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28]


### Task 4: Given a list iterate it and count the occurrence of each element and create a dictionary to show the count of each element
#Original list  [11, 45, 8, 11, 23, 45, 23, 45, 89]
#Printing count of each item   {11: 2, 45: 3, 8: 1, 23: 2, 89: 1}


### Task 5: Given a Python list. Turn every item of a list into its square
#aList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]


### Task 6: Remove empty strings from the list of strings
#list1 = ["Mike", "", "Emma", "Kelly", "", "Brad"]


### Task 7: Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of numbers from 0 to 10
