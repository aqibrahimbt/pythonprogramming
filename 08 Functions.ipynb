    "We have encountered functions before: `print`, `input` and `range`. Python comes with a great number of Python functions that do various useful things. <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html\">Some are directly available to you</a> others first have to be explicitly activated (imported). But the neat thing about functions is that you can also define your own! In fact, writing your own functions is very important to writing larger programs because they help you to structure your program in a clearer way."

In the example above we see that the function `greet` takes one input and this input goes by the name `name`. Finally, after the parentheses you need a colon (:) to mark the beginning of a new code branch, because, as you can see, the code that follows is shifted to the right.\n",

Whenever you have some functionality that you need again and again, it makes a lot of sense to put that functionality in a function so that you can just use the function instead of writing the code again and again."
