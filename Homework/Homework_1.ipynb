    "   Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a ⁠ for ⁠ loop.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2.⁠ ⁠*Sum of Numbers*  \n",
    "   Use a ⁠ for ⁠ loop to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100.\n",

    " 3.⁠ ⁠*List Iteration*  \n",
    "   Given a list of fruits ⁠ [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"] ⁠, print each fruit using a ⁠ for ⁠ loop.\n",
    "\n",
    " 4.⁠ ⁠*Multiplication Table*  \n",
    "   Write a program that generates the multiplication table of a number entered by the user (e.g., for 5: 5 × 1 = 5, 5 × 2 = 10, ...).\n",
    "\n",
    " 5.⁠ ⁠*Reverse String*  \n",
    "   Use a ⁠ for ⁠ loop to reverse a string entered by the user. For example, input: ⁠ \"hello\" ⁠, output: ⁠ \"olleh\" ⁠.\n",

    "### *While Loop Tasks*\n",
    " 6.⁠ ⁠*Countdown*  \n",
    "   Write a program using a ⁠ while ⁠ loop to count down from 10 to 1, and print \"Liftoff!\" when the loop finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    " 7.⁠ ⁠*Password Validation*  \n",
    "   Write a ⁠ while ⁠ loop that asks the user to enter a password until they enter the correct one (e.g., \"Python123\").\n",
    "\n",
    " 8.⁠ ⁠*Sum of Digits*  \n",
    "   Use a ⁠ while ⁠ loop to calculate the sum of digits of a number entered by the user. For example, input: ⁠ 123 ⁠, output: ⁠ 6 ⁠.\n",
    "\n",
    " 9.⁠ ⁠*Guess the Number*  \n",
    "   Create a simple number guessing game using a ⁠ while ⁠ loop. The program should generate a random number between 1 and 10, and the user should keep guessing until they get it right.\n",

    "10.⁠ ⁠*Odd Numbers*  \n",
    "    Use a ⁠ while ⁠ loop to print all odd numbers between 1 and 20."
